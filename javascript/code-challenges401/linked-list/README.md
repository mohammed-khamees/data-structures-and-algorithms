## Singly Linked List

Type of Data structure application where data in the list are considered to be nodes, each node have its value and a refarence to the next node in the list and the fist node in the list called head

## Challenge

writing a class function that create linked lists can be used ti insert,search and print it without using build-in methods

## Approach & Efficiency

for the insert it will be an if statment if there is items or not yet in the LL for the search it is a while loop and the str loops over the items time=>O(n) space=>O(n)

## Solution

created the class to create the node inside the linked list for the insert it will create a node sets the next value as the head value and resets the head for the search it is a while loop as long as the current equal True and the str loops over the items and prints them
